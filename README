The sudowrapper suite, by Emiel Kollof <emiel.kollof@nl.ibm.com>

The sudowrapper suite consists of a set of scripts that will securely let
user do certain tasks as a priviledged user, and even resort to stubbed/
modified library calls to enforce security.

REQUIREMENTS:

A unix system with a perl interpreter (which should be fairly common) and
a Bourne compatible shell. It would be nice if your system supported 
mechanisms like LD_PRELOAD, but it's not required.
